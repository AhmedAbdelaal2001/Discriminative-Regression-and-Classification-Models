# Discriminative-Regression-and-Classification-Models---From-Scratch
## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to supplement my theoretical study of machine learning concepts, and to reinforce the fundamental principles of statistical learning algorithms by implementing them without making use of their standard libraries.  
## Contents
You can find implementations of the following algorithms:  
1. Models based on the Exponential Family distributions such as:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Poisson Regression
