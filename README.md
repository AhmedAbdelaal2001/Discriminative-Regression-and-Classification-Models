# Regression and Classification Models (From Scratch)
## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to complement my theoretical study of foundational machine learning concepts. It contains my solutions to some of the problem sets of Stanford's CS229 course, without making use of ML-specific libraries, such as scikit-learn.  
## Contents
You can find implementations of the following algorithms:  
1. Discriminative GLMs based on Exponential Family distributions such as:
   * Linear Regression.
   * Logistic Regression.
   * Poisson Regression.
2. Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (Generative Model).
