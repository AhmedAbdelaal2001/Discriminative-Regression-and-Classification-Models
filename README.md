# Discriminative-Regression-and-Classification-Models (From-Scratch)
## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to supplement my theoretical study of machine learning concepts, and to reinforce the fundamental principles of statistical learning algorithms by implementing them without making use of their standard libraries such as Scikit-learn.  
## Contents
You can find implementations of the following algorithms:  
1. GLMs based on the Exponential Family distributions such as:
   * Linear Regression (for errors following a Gaussian distribution).
   * Logistic Regression (for predicting a Bernoulli random variable i.e. Binary Classification).
   * Poisson Regression (for predicting a Poisson random variable).
2. The Perceptron Classifier.
3. Decision Trees.
